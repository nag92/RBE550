        #### Draw the X and Y components of the configurations explored by A*


        #### Now that you have computed a path, execute it on the robot using the controller. You will need to convert it into an openrave trajectory. You can set any reasonable timing for the configurations in the path. Then, execute the trajectory using robot.GetController().SetPath(mypath);
